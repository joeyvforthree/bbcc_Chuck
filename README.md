Introduction

Chuck Norris could do this in O(1).

Chuck Norris has an infinite sequence C with C[N] (N >= 1) being the smallest multiple of 4 that
begins with N. So, C[1] is 12, C[2] is 20, C[3] is 32, C[4] is 4, C[5] is 52 and so on. He concatenates all
the digits of C[N] to form an infinite string S which he uses to whiplash his enemies around the world. S
would look like this: 122032452...

Your mission is to find the Kth digit of the string S.

Input Specifications
The input will be a single integer value, k.

Output Specifications
Your output will be the digit representing the value S[k].

Sample Input/Output
Input
1

Output
1

Explanation
The first number C[1] is 12. So the concatenated string S would look like 12... giving 1 as the 1st digit of
the string.
